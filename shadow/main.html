							Growth for the artisan. Accessibility for the consumer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Kanekta is an agency that represents ethical brands within the Canadian apparel industry.
							These brands are artisan driven and are located in areas notorious for sweatshop production.
							Kanekta connects these producers with mainstream retailers to increase availability and normalize ethically sourced products in the market.
							Our mission is directly tied to our partners, the artisans.
							By exposing their brand to new markets, they grow, they scale and are thus able to divert more individuals away from a cycle of exploitation into a fair working environment.
						</p>
						<p>
							We believe that retailers can and should source their products from outlets that generate positive social and environmental impact.
							Brands that prioritize a workerâ€™s livelihood, safe labor conditions and environmental sustainability.
							We want to influence an alternative procurement structure in which retailers place more emphasis on supporting ethically-sourced products because it is what their consumers demand.
							Our approach is unique; we connect artisan powered brands with retailers through business services as well as everyday consumers via a curated platform.
							Our goal is to foster producer growth, boost consumer consciousness and shift retail buying practices to support ethical alternatives.
						</p>

							We are working hard on our launch. To know about the latest news, updates and all things Kanekta, please sign up below!
