								Kanekta is an online B2B marketplace that connects ethical fashion and lifestyle brands to retailers across the world. We broaden the reach of our partner brands while curating a stylish selection for retail buyers. By bringing the buying process onto our intelligent platform, we are rethinking retail procurement.
								</p></center>
						<center>
							<p>
								There is a large supply of conscious products made either as a means to lift communities out of a cycle of exploitation or set an example for sustainable and fair business practice. We believe in collective action, and together with our partner brands and retailers, we aim to make ethical purchasing the norm.
